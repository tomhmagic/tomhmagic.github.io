Iâ€™ve been working in the Minecraft Marketplace for coming up to 4 years now, starting in early 2020 working on a team called Project Moonboot while I waited for my own partnership application to be reviewed. This was the beginning of my addon journey, having a strong grasp of Bedrock commands I started to learn of other people and by ready documentation quickly becoming known to various skills of resource and behaviour packs.

I became an official Marketplace Partner in October 2020, where I worked with a small group of people to produce our own content. For over 3 years of being a partner I have dived headfirst into creating new and innovative content, making sure in each map made I added something brand new to me increasing my knowledge further.

I am now confident in pretty much all areas of resource and behaviour packs in regards to implementing gameplay. From setting up entities, render controllers, molang, animation controllers (both), functions and advanced behaviours. The areas I have started to look into and are my weaker skills are json UI and scripting. However, I have already divided into scripting, being able to create content from events, creating forms and running a gameplay loop. I have recently submitted a new piece of content (not listed below yet) which is 100% controlled via scripting. 

## Skills

-	Implanting entities both resource and behaviour side
-	Advanced entity behaviour including ai, pathfinding, player interactions and projectiles
-	Creating basic particle effects, and implementing particles
