## Craftable Mob Battle
![Craftable Mob Battle](./images/content/cmb/ESF_MarketingKeyArt.jpg)

**Player Goal**
The aim of the map is to create custom mobs using up to 10 different mob parts. Players can choose the base mob, left and right arm and legs to design their mob for battle. Each part gives different strengths and weaknesses and different abilities. Players then can battle them against up to 3 other mobs, either created by their friend or randomly generated by the game.

**My Involvement**
I pretty much completed everything minus the core build and creating the 10 base mob models and robot helper model.

**Resource Pack**
- Setting up all entities
- Linking health molang for mobs health bar display
- Render controllers for switching model parts
